## Toy Programming Language

I'm still developing this language and discovering all of it's incedental nooks and crannys, but hopefully the core of the language is solid enough that I can begin to teach people to use it. This guide on how to use the language will also double as the official documentation for the time being.

If you're familiar with JavaScript, you will see a lot of similarities. However, there are also differences that I hope will make my language stand out in time. I don't expect it to reach JavaScript's popularity, but I would like it to be useful.
