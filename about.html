		<h2>My About Page</h2>
		<p>What to write, what to write... well then. I have no idea. Who thought it'd be a good idea to make me write my own about page? The only thing I can say about myself is that I'm a fairly decent programmer, I love video games a bit too much, I've recently started playing and DMing Dungeons and Dragons, and yes, I did once try to make an MMORPG. I still plan to finish that thing, I swear.</p>
		<p>I currently live in Australia, the asscrack of the world, and as a result I can't find a decent job as a game developer. If you're willing to put up with a remote programmer, I'm taking job offers. Or free money; I also have a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/krgamestudios">patreon page.</a></p>
