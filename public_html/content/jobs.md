KR Game Studios is a small team dedicated to making games; we already have a game on steam! [https://candyraid.com](https://candyraid.com). We're currently looking for a 2D artist to join our team. This artist will have free reign to create what they want, within reason - we're planning on restarting our current metroidvania project from scratch.

Requirements:

* Portfolio of your work
* Experience working on games
* Experience using git, or other command-line programs

Benefits:

* Understanding of unity and/or programming
* Experience with Spriter.net
* Eagerness to learn
