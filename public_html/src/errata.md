# Cast World Errata

For Cast World v1.0.6. All changes will be incorporated into the core rules during the 1.1 update in March.

There is no gameplay errata at the current time.

## Legal Issues

The copyright is 2018, not 2017. Oops!

"Dungeon Master" is the trademark of Wizards of the Coast. I was unaware of this, and will be expunging it from all of my products in the March update, replacing it with "Game Master".
