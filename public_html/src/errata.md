# Cast World Errata

<div class="ui raised segment">

For Cast World v1.0.6. All changes will be incorporated into the core rules during the 1.1 update in March.

The official name is "Can't Anyone Save The World?" - Cast World is an acronym.

When fighting, DMG has a minimum value of 1.

Ignore the note in the Classes section; I forgot to remove it.

An elite class is simply a type of class; it has no meaning at the present time.

At some points, I use the word "Range" where I actually mean "Reach", such as in the Mana Rat's stat block. These two words are synonyms, but I still need to fix this.

# Legal Issues

The copyright is 2018, not 2017. Oops!

"Dungeon Master" is the trademark of Wizards of the Coast. I was unaware of this, and will be expunging it from all of my products in the March update, replacing it with "Game Master".
