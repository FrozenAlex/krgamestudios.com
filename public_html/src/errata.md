# Cast World Errata

For Cast World v1.0.5. All changes will be incorporated into the core rules during the 1.1 update in March.

## Classes

Prerequisites for classes have changed. They are as follows:

* Onion Knight: The character is below 16 years of age. Cannot be multiclassed.
* Pauper: No base stat that is 13 or above. Cannot be multiclassed.
* Fighter: STR 13 or above.
* Privateer: DEX 13 or above.
* Soldier: CON 13 or above.
* Wizard: INT 13 or above.
* Artificer: WIS 13 or above.
* Thespian: CHA 13 or above.
* Cleric: PIT 13 or above.
* Knight: BIR 13 or above.
* Prince: _No change._

## Ability Challenges

Clarification: When an ability challenge is needed, it is presented like this: (WIS +3). This indicates the stat to use (in this case, wisdom) and any bonuses or penalties to apply to the character's stat before rolling (in this case, +3).

## Magic

Some spells are now marked as known or forbidden.

Known spells are automatically available to all classes with that catagory of spells available (assuming you have the prerequisites). All other spells must be learned somehow.

Forbidden spells are strictly unavailable under normal circumstances, and even knowledge of them is surpressed.

Known Spells:

* Barrier
* Dispell
* Firebolt
* Force Missle
* Healing Potion
* Ice Barrier
* Mirror Armour
* Natural Cure
* Terra Spikes
* Second Wind

Forbidden Spells:

* Chimerical Fusion
* False Resurrection

Torchlight Eyes (Verona Village) now costs 1XP to learn under normal circumstances.

## Monsters

Undead Intelligence changed from 2 to 3.
