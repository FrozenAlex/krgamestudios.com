About Me

<div class="ui raised segment">

My name is Kayne Ruse, I've been making games since I was 13, which is over half my life now; I was born with a controller in my hand. I graduated 12th grade in 2009, I studied game development at TAFE for 2 years, and I've been trying to break into the industry ever since.

Although I have a ton of hands-on experience, I lack most formal qualifications that recuiters usually look for. As such, I've resigned myself to using the "indie dev" path to make my name known. I know this is generally the harder method, and requires a lot of luck, but it's the best chance at this point.

I've also found it hard to find employment in other fields. I worked as a kitchen hand for 8 months, and as a web developer intern for 4 months (which opened up amazing new possibilities for me, tech-wise), but otherwise I've been unemployed thus far.
