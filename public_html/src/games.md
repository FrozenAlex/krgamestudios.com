Tortuga
===

(This project is currently on indefinite hold for personal reasons.)

Tortuga is a 2D MMORPG featuring permadeath, with an emphasis on multiplayer cooperation, exploration and customization. The game runs on customizable public and private servers.

This game is inspired by classic 2D RPGs (Final Fantasy, The Legend of Zelda), as well as more modern sandboxes and MMOs (Minecraft, EVE Online). This project is currently independently created and funded, with the goal of creating a game that will engage the players and inspire a large community.

Plains
===

(This project was only ever a prototype.)

This is a geolocation game. What is that, you ask? It get's you off your butt and out into the world! Track down quests on the map screen by searching your local neighbourhood, university or high security detention center for the red markers, and then complete the quests you've collected for rewards!

Labyrinth
===

This is a lightweight pick-up-and-play game built on top of the D20 roleplaying system, while also incorporating randomization via cards. Choose one of four unique races: human, woodfolk, oxkin and hollow and delve into the titular labyrinth. Face off against goblins, kobolds, giant eyeball monsters and many others, and cart your loot back to town! Recommended for 3-6 players, plus a dungeon master.
