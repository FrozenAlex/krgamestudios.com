Mecha: Immense Warfare
===

Mecha: Immense Warfare is a trading card game where the goal is to move across the game board and deal five points of direct damage to your opponent. You do this using mecha cards, which represent giant combat machines, command cards which convey various effects on the game, stationary tower cards which maintain control over the wild mechas (if just barely), and finally pilot cards, which feature the human characters of the game, and convey their own boons to their mecha of choice.

Tortuga
===

(This project is currently on indefinite hold for personal reasons.)

Tortuga is a 2D MMORPG featuring permadeath, with an emphasis on multiplayer cooperation, exploration and customization. The game runs on customizable public and private servers.

This game is inspired by classic 2D RPGs (Final Fantasy, The Legend of Zelda), as well as more modern sandboxes and MMOs (Minecraft, EVE Online). This project is currently independently created and funded, with the goal of creating a game that will engage the players and inspire a large community.
