Can't Anyone Save The World?
===

AKA "Cast World" for short.

"Can't Anyone Save The World?" is inspired by both classic and modern tabletop RPGs; this simple but extensible RPG is designed to be quick to start with easy to intuit rules. It comes with a new setting baked in, filled with unique races (human, woodfolk, oxkin and hollow) and scenarios. This is very much a labour of love, so please leave your feedback below!

To play, youâ€™ll need 3 six-sided dice (referred to as d6), paper, a pencil, and imagination. This game is designed for 3 to 7 players, and a dungeon master (or DM for short).

To make a new character, roll for stats, then choose a race, class and elemental affinity. Finally, you're ready to play! Roll high during combat, and roll low during ability challenges; don't forget the roleplaying, of course - that's the other half of the game!

The core rules also come bundled with a short adventure called "Verona Village", which demonstrates the core rules, and adds some new content as well as fleshing out a small part of the world. New adventures will be released on DriveThruRPG every two weeks, so check back often!

Recommended for 3-6 players, plus a dungeon master.

Mecha: Immense Warfare
===

Mecha: Immense Warfare is a trading card game where the goal is to move across the game board and deal five points of direct damage to your opponent. You do this using mecha cards, which represent giant combat machines, command cards which convey various effects on the game, stationary tower cards which maintain control over the wild mechas (if just barely), and finally pilot cards, which feature the human characters of the game, and convey their own boons to their mecha of choice.

(This project is currently on indefinite hold for personal reasons.)

Tortuga is a 2D MMORPG featuring permadeath, with an emphasis on multiplayer cooperation, exploration and customization. The game runs on customizable public and private servers.

This game is inspired by classic 2D RPGs (Final Fantasy, The Legend of Zelda), as well as more modern sandboxes and MMOs (Minecraft, EVE Online). This project is currently independently created and funded, with the goal of creating a game that will engage the players and inspire a large community.

Plains
===

(This project was only ever a prototype.)

This is a geolocation game. What is that, you ask? It get's you off your butt and out into the world! Track down quests on the map screen by searching your local neighbourhood, university or high security detention center for the red markers, and then complete the quests you've collected for rewards!
