TurtleMap
===

A generic lua-backed C++ tiled map system. Formerly part of Tortuga. TurtleMap requires lua 5.3 or later and TurtleGUI (for graphics only).

* [TurtleMap Source Code](https://github.com/krgamestudios/TurtleMap)

TurtleGUI
===

A small graphical user interface library. TurtleGUI requires SDL2, SDL_image and SDL_ttf. Other than that, it should be a self contained package.

This Website!
===

This website is based off of the same tech as the Mecha: Immense Warfare website, which in turn was designed as a simple reference to be looked up on mobile. Make of that what you will.
