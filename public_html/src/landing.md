Can't Anyone Save The World?
===

AKA "Cast World" for short.

"Can't Anyone Save The World?" is inspired by both classic and modern tabletop RPGs; this simple but extensible RPG is designed to be quick to start with easy to intuit rules. It comes with a new setting baked in, filled with unique races (human, woodfolk, oxkin and hollow) and scenarios. This is very much a labour of love, so please leave your feedback below!

To play, youâ€™ll need 3 six-sided dice (referred to as d6), paper, a pencil, and imagination. This game is designed for 3 to 7 players, and a dungeon master (or DM for short).

To make a new character, roll for stats, then choose a race, class and elemental affinity. Finally, you're ready to play! Roll high during combat, and roll low during ability challenges; don't forget the roleplaying, of course - that's the other half of the game!

The core rules also come bundled with a short adventure called "Verona Village", which demonstrates the core rules, and adds some new content as well as fleshing out a small part of the world. New adventures will be released on DriveThruRPG every two weeks, so check back often!
