Welcome!
===

My current projects are: Adventure and The Portal. Click the buttons above to see my other projects.

Adventure (Working Title)
===

Inspired by a number of popular tabletop RPGs, this simple but fully featured RPG is designed to be easy to start and to play. It comes with a new setting baked in, filled with unique races and scenarios. This is currently in active development.

The Portal
===

The Portal is a shallow clone of Facebook, tailored for D&D players. It's incomplete, but it already demonstrates my knowledge of ReactJS, NodeJS, MySQL and associated tools.
