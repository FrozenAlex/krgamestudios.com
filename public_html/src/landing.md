Can't Anyone Save The World?

AKA "Cast World" for short.

Inspired by both classic and modern tabletop RPGs, this simple but fully featured RPG is designed to be quick to start with easy to intuit rules. It comes with a new setting baked in, filled with unique races and scenarios. This is currently in active development.
