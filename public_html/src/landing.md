Welcome!
===

My current projects are: Labyrinth, Adventure and The Portal. Click the buttons above to see my other projects.

Labyrinth
===

This is a lightweight print-and-play game where your party explores deeper and deeper into the titular dungeon known as the labyrinth. Choose one of four unique races: human, woodfolk, oxkin and hollow, face off against goblins, kobolds, giant eyeball monsters and other strange beasts, and cart your loot back to town! Recommended for 3-6 players, plus a dungeon master.

Adventure (Working Title)
===

This is a lightweight but fully featured tabletop RPG set in the same world as Labyrinth. It has yet to be playtested, or properly released.

The Portal
===

The Portal is a shallow clone of Facebook, tailored for D&D players. It's incomplete, but it already demonstrates my knowledge of ReactJS, NodeJS, MySQL and associated tools.
