My current project is: [Mecha: Immense Warfare Trading Card Game](http://mecha.krgamestudios.com/).

Mecha: Immense Warfare is a trading card game where the goal is to move across the game board and deal five points of direct damage to your opponent. You do this using mecha cards, which represent giant combat machines, command cards which convey various effects on the game, stationary tower cards which maintain control over the wild mechas, if just barely, and finally pilot cards, which feature the human characters of the game, and convey their own boons to their mecha of choice.
