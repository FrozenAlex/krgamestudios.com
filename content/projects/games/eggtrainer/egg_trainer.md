Raise, train and battle creatures from eggs!

Inspired by popular monster battling games, Egg Trainer allows you to buy eggs from the market, hatch them, then train them - each one is different, and even creatures within the same species can vary wildly in strengths.

Once you've trained a set of six powerful creatures, you can battle them against other players!

Your creatures fight in pairs, with each creature having a choice of four different actions. Some actions will gain benefits or drawbacks depending on the elemental type of your creature, the move, and the opponent's creature.

You can also breed creatures to produce new eggs, some of which are extremely rare.

What will you hatch next?
