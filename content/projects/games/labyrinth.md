This is a lightweight print-and-play game where your party explores deeper and deeper into the titular dungeon known as the labyrinth. Choose one of four unique races: human, woodfolk, oxkin and hollow, face off against goblins, kobolds, giant eyeball monsters and other strange beasts, and cart your loot back to town! Recommended for 3-6 players, plus a dungeon master.
